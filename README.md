<h3>About This Project</h3>
<p>This was the final project for the <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/responsive">Scrimba Reponsive Design Bootcamp</a>, a course that covers the ins and outs of responsive design, focusing particulary on the power of Flexbox and Grid in layouts, accessiblity in markup, and making your CSS reusable. It's a three page business site with a responsive layout created primarily using CSS-Grid. It also includes a mobile menu controlled by a little JS.
